                    On one stormy night, David was watching the news. He had heard of many strange space adventures before, but never something like what he was seeing now. What am I talking about? You guessed it right! He was just watching the live news about the mission to planet Olika, an unknown planet somewhere in outer space. As David and his family lived in a city called Diamondville, their city needed a big diamond jewel, (and by big, I mean a 7 feet square big diamond). The problem was that the Olika aliens had stolen it overnight, when nobody was watching. Diamondville could not last for more than three weeks without that gem of power (we’ll call it gem, for short). However, the biggest problem was the creatures living on planet Olika. Once, scientists sent out a satellite to land on the planet Mars but it landed on the unknown planet at the time (Olika). What the scientists noticed was ugly, three-eyed creatures, and I can’t explain more about how ugly they look. That is why nobody, not even the strongest astronaut, dared to go. So David decided to go. He decided to go in the morning. So he slept dreaming about his adventure.

                </center><br />
                <p>
                    The next morning, when he woke up, he told his parents about his plan. Instead of being worried, they were proud and confident that their son was going on an adventure to outer space. He went to the space academy and borrowed a rocket. He went to the launching pad, learned how to take off and land eagerly and quickly (for he was a fast learner) and took off in no time.
                    An hour later he was in outer space, out of Earth’s atmosphere and used the radar to find where planet Olika was. He used all the sensors, cameras, and radars he knew on the rocket, but planet Olika was nowhere to be found. Suddenly a call sign came on one of the screens of the rocket. When he picked it up, it was the astronauts who were calling him down from Earth. They told him to use the top radar which was on the highest level by pressing the blue button. When he did so, he could see planet Olika as clearly as ever. He thanked the scientists and disconnected the call. He then landed on the planet Olika a week later. When he stepped on the planet, it was very slimy. He went back in and got his big boots. The boots weren’t perfect, but they were better than walking with sneakers. He climbed out of the rocket and started his journey on planet Olika.

                    As he started walking, in the distance he saw something that looked like a modern city! As he headed to it, something seized his astronaut suit by its belt. When he spun around to investigate what it was, he couldn’t believe what he’d seen. It was an Olika monster! The monster muttered some inarticulate sounds that were inaudible to David. I think that if you saw an unknown monster that had three red-eyes and a 2 feet wide mouth, you would be afraid. However, David was totally unafraid. The first thing he did was say hello to the ugly monster and surprisingly, so did the monster. The monster asked him his name, to which David replied correctly. The monster then sniffed David out, telling him that he was one of the guards on planet Olika. He also said that he was the nicest guard on planet Olika and if he went to any other guard, they wouldn’t allow him to enter. However, he was letting him go because he knew he wouldn’t do any harm to them. David then continued his adventure and went to the gate of the city apparently being called Diamond City. There he saw aliens called ‘gate protectors.’ They were two grumpy looking aliens who wouldn’t let him go inside. Oh, and before I continue on with the story, I wanted to tell you that these creatures didn’t have good eyesight. Remembering this, David turned around, went back to his rocket and changed into his alien halloween costume, which looked exactly like the aliens, and tried again.  Believe it or not, it actually worked! The grumpy aliens let him inside the city. As soon as they opened the big gate door, a large light shone on him. When he looked to see what it was, it was the diamond! He stepped inside and walked his journey further down Diamond city. He met many ugly looking creatures along his way. He stopped by one of them and asked them where the king of the city was. The alien didn’t understand David. He told him to the ‘translator alien’ in his alienese language but luckily, David understood.
                </p>
                <p>When he went to the translator and asked him the same question, he answered that he was in the palace. David walked towards the big castle. He saw the king’s servants on every single step of the royal staircase. They played a big tuba horn, which was a signal to call the king. David wondered how the king would go down the- he counted up all the stairs- down the five-thousand stairs. The king then came marching down. Somebody had thrown a banana peel on the second step and when the king stepped on the banana peel, whoosh, down he came tumbling. It took him a whole Earth day for him to come down the stairs. This time, the aliens got so bored that they got some cards to play with to keep themselves entertained. Oh, and just to remind you, two weeks of his three-week adventure had been over. Soon, after a short period of time, the king finally reached his destination (the end of the staircase). David then said hello to the king.</p><p> The king replied and asked him who he was and what he came for. David said that he was from the planet Earth and he had come to take the diamond back. The king was kind so he said that he would love to but that they needed a mascot for their city. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you, David was a very good artist. David said that if they gave their diamond, he would draw a really beautiful, 3D diamond. The king gathered all his people and had a small discussion. They had a vote and 50 people voted to keep it and 51 people decided to give it away. So David took the diamond and drew a diamond like he had promised. He then said goodbye and got back into his spacecraft, but it wouldn’t start! The guard didn’t know this but he gave a big gasoline can as a “return gift.” David was really happy. He had thought that he would be stuck on planet Olika. He then turned on the rocket jets and soon left for home. Within an hour he reached back to Earth. He got off the rocket and walked proudly with the diamond in his hand. He gave the diamond to the mayor, who put the diamond in its place and even added a laser layer to protect the diamond. Nobody wanted this incident to happen again. David went home and enjoyed the rest of the day with his parents. He was very happy. The next day his parents said they had a present for him. They told him to go into the garage and lift up the sheet that was hiding something. When he did, he saw a big bicycle! He hugged and thanked his parents for the wonderful surprise. And now, the story has ended with a very, very, very happy ending.</p>

                    Kevin was a curious boy who loved science. He was always eager to learn new things and try out new experiments. He had been looking forward to the day when they would finally get to make their own scientific, magic liquid for days. He spent hours with his friends, Ben, James, and Shelly, brainstorming ideas about what they should make. They considered making a liquid that could make your hair longer than your body or something that could make you as big as a skyscraper. They finally decided that they would create a liquid that would make anything it spilled on five centimetres tall. They thought this would be perfect for shrinking the vegetable they all hated the most- broccoli!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Kevin was so excited that he woke up early in the morning and quickly finished his breakfast so he could get on the school bus and head to school. The first thing they had on the schedule was maths, which was Kevin's second-favourite subject after science. They were learning about decimals, which their maths teacher, Mr. David, said were essential if they wanted to become anything, whether it was a doctor or a scientist. Kevin paid very close attention during maths class because he wanted to be a scientist when he grew up.
                    Science was the next thing on the schedule, and Kevin was keenly watching the clock for when the bell would ring. Finally, Ding Dong! The bell had rung, and Kevin, Ben, James, and Shelly (The awesome scientists, as they called themselves) went to the science lab. However, they were disappointed to find that their teacher, Miss Kate, was nowhere to be seen! They looked around everywhere, but she was nowhere to be found. The substitute teacher, Mr. King, sadly informed them that their planned activities for the day would be postponed. The only bright side was that they would get a longer lunch break. Kevin was disappointed and went to the lunch counter to get some food from the lunch lady. He tried to cheer himself up by reminding himself that tomorrow was another day. He took the bus home and did his after-school daily routine before going to bed, dreaming about tomorrow.

                    The next morning, Kevin woke up early and had his cereal before quickly getting on the school bus. They had science class just before lunch like they did yesterday. They did maths first and then science. Kevin crossed his fingers and prayed that they would get to do yesterday's activity, and to his relief, their teacher, Miss Kate, was present! She said they could immediately start their project. The “awesome scientists” got to work on their project, and they were having a lot of fun. They mixed different chemicals, and before they knew it, they had created the magic liquid.
                    But then, something unexpected happened. Ben reached over to get a napkin to clean his hands and accidentally spilled the liquid on Kevin! In less than two seconds, Kevin was as small as five centimeters!
                    Kevin didn't know what to do. He screamed out for Miss Kate, but she couldn't hear him. He ran as fast as he could to go through the door, and because he was the fastest runner in the class, he made it. But now what would he do? He went out to the street, and the cars that were racing down the street seemed like giants! He tried to move, but every time he did, another car would speed past him. They never stopped! Suddenly, he heard a loud buzzing sound. When he looked, he saw a giant bee. Before he wasn't afraid of bees or other insects, but now, as he was five centimeters tall, he didn't have anything to do but to fear. The bee came and suddenly grabbed him and took him to its beehive.
                </p>
                <center><img src="depositphotos_34532185-stock-photo-3d-small-people-tall-ruler.jpg" height="400" /></center>
                <p>
                    Now he was trapped in the beehive outside of their school. He thought to himself that he would have to stay there and then secretly creep out in the morning to go to school. It was nighttime now, so Kevin gathered some honey and made a bed for himself. He soon fell asleep and woke up in the morning. He walked to the school, which took almost half an hour, as he was so small. When he entered school, it was science class. When he walked to the lab, Ben was standing there. He picked up Kevin, put him on the table, and said that he was very sorry. Kevin sighed and said it was okay. Ben said that to say sorry, he had made a liquid that would make anything that had shrunk back to normal size. Kevin was so happy. Ben put a few drops of the liquid on Kevin, and within seconds he was back to his normal size. Kevin hugged Ben and said thank you.
                    Now this story has a happy ending, and Kevin learned that even when things don't go as planned, there is always a way to make things right. He continued to be curious and eager to learn more about science, and he never forgot the lesson he learned about the importance of being patient and never giving up.

                    Once upon a time, lived a pack of geese. I was the youngest one of these and everybody cared for me. Beside our pond, there was a very kind family. They cared for Canadian geese like myself.
                    Time for migration was approaching. It was starting to get colder in Canada and warmer in the southern areas. We had one day until it was the perfect time for migrating. Me and my family had decided we would take our leave in the morning.
                    It was starting to get dark outside. My family was getting ready for sleep. And so was I. We had to get ready for tomorrow. It will be a long day.

                    The next day, A stroke of sunlight hit my feathers and that is when I knew when to wake up. Or at least, I thought it was. When I opened my eyes and looked around, nobody was there. I looked to my left and then I looked to my right, but nobody was there. I started to get worried. “Oh no,” I thought as I moved around, “if my family isn’t here, how will I get to the south and find them?” Tears started to flow down my cheeks.
                    Suddenly, I saw some creatures come toward me. When I looked closely, it turned out to be the family who lived beside us. Watching their moves, I came to learn that they had come out for their evening stroll. I tried to grab their attention and tried to make them come to me, and sure enough, it worked! This family was a friend of mine, so they understood. Dave, the father of the kids, said that unfortunately they didn’t know how to help. And on saying this, they left and continued their walk. I started to get worried. I looked up and noticed that it was getting dark. “Already?” I thought to myself. I built a small nest of old wood and slept. I would have to start my journey tomorrow.

                    The next day arrived with heavy rain, as it fell upon my feathers. The plan for the day would have to be cancelled and postponed to the following day.
                    Luckily, on the next day, the weather was perfectly fine and I decided that this would be the day for his adventure. I opened my wings, (which weren't too big, after all) flapped them and took my leave. And from here, my adventure started.
                    Along the way, I met many creatures. My first encounter was with a big eagle. It didn’t seem too kind, and so I didn’t stand back to chat around with him. The second thing I saw was a big, metal cylinder, which had two pairs of wings and a fan on each side. I wasn’t sure what it is called but I think people call it an airplane. The last thing I saw was a big bird. This one was actually one of my friends. It was a swan. I am actually glad I met the swan because he said some really pleasant words. He said that he had seen his family and told me where they had landed. He said they were currently resting in northern Mexico. I thanked my friend and continued my journey.
                    I finally reached the destination and met my family. I was very happy and everybody lived happily ever after.

                    Once upon a time, there was a young boy named Max. He lived in a small town with his parents and younger sister. Max was a curious and adventurous boy who loved to explore the world around him.

                    One day, Max decided to go on a hike through the nearby woods. As he walked, he heard a faint whimpering noise. Following the sound, he discovered a small puppy, abandoned and alone.

                    Max couldn't bear to leave the puppy behind, so he picked it up and decided to take it home. He named the puppy "Lucky" and they quickly became inseparable friends.

                    Over the years, Max and Lucky had many adventures together. They explored the woods, played in the park, and went on long walks. Lucky was always by Max's side, and Max felt grateful to have such a loyal companion.

                    As Max grew older, he went through some tough times. He struggled with school and didn't know what he wanted to do with his life. But Lucky was always there to lift his spirits and give him hope.

                    One day, Max came across a flyer for a dog training program. He decided to enroll Lucky, hoping it would give them something to do together and bring some purpose to his life.

                    The training program was challenging, but Max and Lucky worked hard together. Max learned new skills and techniques, and Lucky became a well-behaved and obedient dog.

                    Max and Lucky started entering dog competitions, and they quickly gained a reputation for being a great team. They won many awards and made many friends along the way.

                    Years passed, and Max grew old. Lucky was no longer a puppy, but he was still by Max's side, just as loyal as ever. Max looked back on his life and realized that Lucky had been there through it all - the good times and the bad.

                    Eventually, Lucky passed away, leaving Max heartbroken. But he knew that Lucky had given him more than just companionship - he had given him a purpose, a passion, and a lifelong friend.

                    Once upon a time, there was a small fishing village nestled on the coast of a beautiful island. The villagers were simple folk, who made their living by fishing and trading with other villages.

                    One day, a powerful storm hit the island. The winds were strong, and the waves were high. The villagers feared for their lives as they struggled to keep their boats and homes intact.

                    As the storm raged on, a young girl named Sara noticed a small boat being tossed around in the waves. She knew that someone must be in trouble and decided to brave the storm to rescue them.

                    Sara grabbed a rope and tied it around her waist before diving into the water. She fought against the powerful currents and swam towards the boat.

                    Inside the boat was a young man named Alex, who had been out at sea when the storm hit. He was injured and unable to move, and feared that he would not survive the storm.

                    But Sara was determined to save him. She pulled him onto her back and swam back towards the shore, with the rope tied to her waist helping her to navigate the waves.

                    When they finally reached the shore, the villagers were amazed at Sara's bravery. They tended to Alex's wounds and made sure that he was safe and comfortable.

                    As he spent more time with Sara, he began to realize that he had feelings for her. She was strong and brave, and he admired her for risking her life to save his.

                    One day, he mustered up the courage to tell her how he felt. To his delight, she felt the same way. They fell in love and spent many happy days together.

                    But their happiness was short-lived. Alex had to return to his own village, which was far away from Sara's. They were heartbroken at the thought of being separated, but promised to write to each other and stay in touch.

                    Years passed, and the letters between them became fewer and farther between. Sara missed Alex terribly, but she knew that they were both living their own lives.

                    One day, Sara received a letter from Alex, telling her that he was coming to visit. She was overjoyed and spent days preparing for his arrival.

                    When Alex finally arrived, Sara was amazed at how much he had changed. He was no longer the young man she had fallen in love with. He had aged and had many stories to tell.

                    Despite the changes, they spent a wonderful few days together, reminiscing about old times and catching up on everything that had happened in their lives.

                    But the visit was short-lived, and Alex had to return to his own village. Sara was sad to see him go, but she knew that they would always have the memories of their time together.

                    Years passed once again, and Sara never forgot the love she had shared with Alex. She lived a happy life, surrounded by family and friends, but always held a special place in her heart for the young man she had saved from the storm.

                    One day, when she was an old woman, a man arrived in the village. He was tall and handsome, with piercing blue eyes and a charming smile. He introduced himself as Alex's son.

                    Sara was surprised and delighted to meet him. They talked for hours, and the man told her all about his father and how much he had loved her.

                    Sara felt a deep sense of joy and gratitude, knowing that the love she had shared with Alex had lived on through their son. She realized that sometimes, the love we share can have a lasting impact on the world around us, even after we are gone.

                    James had always been a curious child. He was the kind of kid who loved to take things apart to see how they worked, and then put them back together again. His parents encouraged his curiosity, and even bought him his own set of tools when he was only six years old. From that moment on, James was hooked.

                    As he got older, James became more and more interested in electronics. He spent hours tinkering with circuit boards, learning how to solder and program microcontrollers. By the time he was in high school, he was building his own robots and gadgets.

                    One day, James heard about a robotics competition that was coming to his town. It was open to high school students, and the winner would receive a full scholarship to a prestigious university. James knew that he had to enter.

                    He worked tirelessly on his robot, tweaking and adjusting its sensors and programming until it was just right. Finally, the day of the competition arrived. James was nervous, but also excited. He knew that his robot was the best one there.

                    The competition was intense. There were robots of all shapes and sizes, each with its own unique abilities. But James' robot was a standout. It was fast and agile, with incredible reflexes and a sophisticated control system.

                    In the end, James' robot emerged victorious. He was overjoyed. Not only had he won the scholarship, but he had also proved to himself that he had what it took to succeed in the world of robotics.

                    Over the next few years, James continued to excel in his studies. He majored in electrical engineering, and went on to earn a PhD in robotics. He published several groundbreaking papers on artificial intelligence and robotics, and became known as one of the top minds in the field.

                    But despite his success, James never forgot his roots. He continued to tinker with robots and gadgets in his spare time, and even started a robotics club at the local high school. He loved teaching young students about the wonders of robotics, and watching them discover their own passions and interests.

                    One day, James received a call from an old friend. The friend worked at a robotics company, and was looking for someone to lead their research and development team. James was hesitant at first. He had always enjoyed his academic work, and was happy teaching and tinkering on his own. But the more he thought about it, the more he realized that this could be an incredible opportunity.

                    He took the job, and soon found himself leading a team of some of the most talented engineers and designers in the world. They worked on cutting-edge projects, pushing the boundaries of what was possible in the field of robotics.

                    Despite the challenges and long hours, James loved his work. He felt fulfilled in a way that he never had before. He knew that he was making a difference, not just in the field of robotics, but in the world at large.

                    And yet, despite his success, James never lost sight of what was truly important. He remained humble and kind, always eager to help others and share his knowledge. He continued to work with young students, inspiring them to follow their dreams and pursue their passions.

                    Years passed, and James grew older. He retired from his job at the robotics company, but never stopped tinkering with robots and gadgets. He continued to teach and mentor young students, passing on his knowledge and wisdom to the next generation.

                    And when he finally passed away, surrounded by his family and friends, James left behind a legacy that would never be forgotten. He had lived a life filled with curiosity, passion, and purpose. He had inspired countless people to follow their dreams, and had made the world a better place through his work in robotics. And even in death, his spirit lived on, in the hearts and minds of all those whose lives he

                    Once upon a time, in a far-off land, there was a kingdom ruled by a just and kind king. The kingdom was prosperous and peaceful, and the people were happy. But one day, a dark cloud appeared on the horizon, and with it came a terrible curse that threatened to destroy everything the kingdom had built.

                    The curse was cast by an evil witch who had long been banished from the kingdom. She had vowed revenge on the king and his people, and now she had found a way to make her threat a reality. She had created a powerful potion that would bring death and destruction to the kingdom, and she had cast it upon the land.

                    The king was horrified when he learned of the curse. He called upon his wisest advisors and most skilled knights to find a way to break the spell. But they could not find a way to do so, for the curse was too powerful.

                    The king then called upon his daughter, a young princess with a heart full of courage and a mind full of curiosity. The princess was determined to save her kingdom, so she set out on a quest to find a way to break the curse.

                    She traveled far and wide, seeking the advice of wise old wizards and brave knights. She visited ancient libraries and consulted with learned scholars. But all their wisdom was of no use, for no one knew how to break the curse.
                </p><p>
                    One day, as the princess was traveling through a dark and dangerous forest, she came upon a strange old woman. The woman was dressed in rags and her hair was tangled and wild. But her eyes sparkled with a strange wisdom, and the princess knew at once that she was someone special.

                    The old woman listened to the princess's story and nodded her head thoughtfully. "I know of a way to break the curse," she said. "But it is a difficult and dangerous path."

                    The princess was willing to do whatever it took to save her kingdom, so she asked the old woman to tell her what she needed to do.

                    The old woman instructed the princess to journey to the top of the highest mountain in the land, where she would find a rare flower that grew only in the light of the full moon. The flower was said to have magical powers that could break any curse.

                    The princess set out at once, determined to find the flower. She climbed the mountain, facing treacherous cliffs and fierce winds. But she persevered, and at last she reached the summit.

                    There, in a clearing bathed in the light of the full moon, she found the rare flower. She picked it carefully and began her descent down the mountain.

                    But as she was making her way back down, she was set upon by the evil witch's minions. They tried to steal the flower from her, but the princess fought them off with all her might.

                    At last, she reached the kingdom, exhausted but triumphant. She presented the flower to the king, who crushed it into a potion that he then poured over the land.

                    As the potion spread, the curse was broken. The sky cleared, the birds began to sing, and the people of the kingdom rejoiced.

                    The princess was hailed as a hero, and the king praised her for her courage and determination. The kingdom prospered once more, and the people lived in peace and harmony.

                    And the princess? She went on to have many more adventures, for she was a brave and curious soul who could never resist the call of the unknown. But she always remembered the quest that had saved her kingdom, and she knew that she would never forget the lessons she had learned along the way.
